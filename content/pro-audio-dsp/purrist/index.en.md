Purrist is an advanced guitar noise gate and hum-canceller. It is designed to prevent all of the artifacts typical to electric guitars. What distinguishes it from the others is its ability to preserve the natural sustain of your instrument. It is developed using JUCE framework and it will be available as a VST3, AU, and iOS AUv3 plugin.

### Buzz

This is where you can suppress the AC buzz (also known as hum) induced by electrical installation. It comes especially handy when your guitar is equipped with single-coil pickups. Advanced filters can cancel the noise without reducing the sustain, even when your wildest distortion is on.

### Fizz

The "Fizz" section will handle any high-frequency interference, such as white noise. It is basically a dynamic shelving filter that attenuates high frequencies when the decaying string sound loses its treble content anyway.

### Noise

The last stage is a classic expander-type noise gate. Instead of shutting the sound off completely when the level is below the threshold, the volume is attenuated gradually. The lower the volume, the more attenuation will be applied. The result is a much more natural transition.
