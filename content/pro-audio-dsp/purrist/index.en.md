Purrist is an advanced guitar noise gate. It is designed to prevent all of the artifacts typical to electric guitars. What distinguishes this plugin from others is that it preserves the natural sustain of your instrument. It is developed using JUCE framework and it will be available as a VST3, AU, and iOS AUv3 plugin.

### Buzz

This section is responsible for preventing AC inducted noise, notorious for disturbing the single coil pickups. Advanced filters can cancel the noise without reducing the sustain, even when your wildest distortion is on.

### Fizz

In this module, you can get rid of high-frequency noise. A shelf filter reduces the trebles below a certain threshold when higher harmonics are gone anyway.

### Noise

The Noise module is a classic expanding noise gate. Its job is to eliminate any artifacts not addressed by the first two sections.
