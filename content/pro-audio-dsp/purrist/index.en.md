Purrist is a state-of-the-art noise suppressor designed primarily for use with electric guitars. Its ability to preserve your guitar's sustain distinguishes it from other plugins and hardware gates. The three sections of the plugin target AC hum, white noise, and other interference. Purrist is currently available for iPad and Apple Silicon Macs.
