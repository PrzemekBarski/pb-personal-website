<p>For every project I am part of, my main focus is its goal. I analyze every feature in terms of its business values ​​so I can choose optimal solutions for them. Sometimes your goal can be achieved with simpler means, and sometimes a better idea is to increase the budget for the best benefit. Is CMS implementation worth the trouble until you know how often the website will be updated? Or the other way around - if we can predict regular updates, maybe it is worth spending more now to save money in the long run?</p>
<p>If possible, I try to participate in the web design process from the beginning, which allows me to outline the technological context, e.g. point out risky design solutions at an early stage. I can also make sure that the design includes all the hidden elements, such as <code class="u-bg-gray-2">alt</code> attributes for images, search engines and social media meta tags, etc.</p>
