I have been coding websites for nine years. My first job was at **Chop-Chop.org** company, where I created mainly WordPress templates and [plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/chopchoporg/#content-plugins). With the help of excellent developers I met there, I took my first steps in making the Internet and learned the object-oriented programming in PHP.

Then I worked in the marketing department of **LiveChat** (now **Text.com**). I was creating SEO-focused landing pages, sometimes larger sections such as Careers or Help Center, and occasionally more complex applications, such as the Customer Service Report written using the Vue.js framework. We built our web pages with Hugo static page generator. In addition to new technologies, I learned a lot about product marketing in the SaaS model there.
