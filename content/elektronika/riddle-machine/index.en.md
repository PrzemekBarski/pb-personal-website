This all-analog audio effect has endless sonic possibilities and works equally well with guitar, bass, synthesizer, or any other electric/electronic instrument. At its heart, there is a configurable filter controlled by your playing dynamics, LFO, or expression pedal. You can also use the pedal to control the speed of the LFO.

Riddle Machine also features a distinctive fuzz that, combined with a filter, will give your guitar a sound reminiscent of an analog synthesizer. You can also use it like a classic wah, but its range and aggressive resonance are one of a kind.
