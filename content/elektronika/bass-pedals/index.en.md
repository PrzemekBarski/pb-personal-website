Bass Pedals is a programmable MIDI foot controller. It was inspired by bassists like Mike Rutherford or John Paul Jones, who often doubled as rhythm guitarists on stage and played the bassline with an organ foot keyboard.

Bass Pedals is a compact version of such a keyboard designed for musicians who do not need immediate access to the whole octave.
Each of the four programmable buttons can be assigned to even four notes of your choice, so you can play chords as well. You can also control a connected instrument remotely via Control Change and Program Change messages. The memory of the device can store 99 programmed configurations.
