Bass Pedals is a programmable MIDI foot controller. It was inspired by such bassists as Mike Rutherford or John Paul Jones, who often grabbed an electric guitar on stage and supported themselves with an organ foot keyboard in order to play the bass line. Bass Pedals is a compact version of such a keyboard designed for musicians who do not need immediate access to the whole octave.

Each of the four programmable buttons can be assigned to even four notes of your choice, so you can also use them to play chords. You can also use them to remotely control a connected instrument via Control Change and Program Change messages. The memory of the device can store 99 programmed configurations.
