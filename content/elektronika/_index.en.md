I have been doing commercial electronic projects since 2012. I have succesfully delivered several dozens of them. I specialize in analog and digital devices for musicians and recording studios, but I have also designed railway industry equipment.

I have a well-equipped and ESD-protected laboratory to build and test high-quality prototypes.
