I develop commercial electronic projects since 2012. I have succesfully delivered many circuit and product designs. I specialize in analog and digital tools for musicians and recording studios, but I have experience with railway industry equipment and automotive projects too.

Since June 2023 I also work for R&D department of Faurecia Pneumatic. My job is to design and prototype mechatronic circuits for car comfort systems.

I have a well-equipped and ESD-protected laboratory to build and test high-quality prototypes.
